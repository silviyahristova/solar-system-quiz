### **Scope**

The main features that will be implemented into the website will be included on two separate pages. The design of the website should look fun, educational and interesting at the same time simple and eye-catching. In help to create this design will be carefully selected color palette and fonts.

The site will have challenging questions before the start of the quiz. This will help users think, that they are participating in an adventure quiz, so they can be motivated to answer the questions correctly to prove themselves that they are worthy of the challenge. The website will have how to play section, which will include the rules of the quiz. It will have also contact details and social media links, making it easy for users to get in touch.

### **Structure**

The structure of the website is to have two separate pages - game page and contact page. It is designed to be mobile-first design. Every page will have a header,logo and footer. There will be an additional 404.html page.

### **Skeleton**

To create the wireframes, the design tool Figma is used. There were fifteen frames created- for the main function on the two pages and for three devices- desktop, tablet, and mobile. They were created to help establish a clear and organized structure for the website. They provide an outline of the layout how elements will be arranged on the screen, and how the interface will adopt the different screen sizes and devices, laying the foundation for responsive design.

**Colour**

The color palette is selected based on the unique meaning of each colors and their combination together. Purple and violet colors promote harmony of the mind and the emotions, contributing to mental balance and stability, peace of mind, a link between the spiritual and the physical worlds, between thought and ativity.The color orange radiates warmth and happiness, combining the physical energy and stimulation of red with the cheerfulness of yellow. The color psychology of orange is optimistic and uplifting, rejuvenating our spirit. Peach encourages great communication and conversation. It inspires good manners and puts people at ease. It has all the attributes of orange but in a much softer, gentler and more cautious form. This version of orange encourages vitality and self-control. Using apricot can evoke feelings of warmth and friendliness. This color communicates a sense of comfort and approachability, making it ideal for creating inviting and cheerful spaces.

**Typography**

The fonts that will be used in the website will be imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and will be used [Engagement](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Engagement) and [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora). Semi-formal with a steady hand and soft contours, Engagement is a brush script that dances a line between vintage and modern flair.This classic calligraphic script font is perfect for amazing postcard designs, wedding invitation designs, image headings, and titling purposes. Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs.

**Logo**

The logo is created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVX0sxbDk/QxmT7W9rV6dBT0eca0dxVw/edit) logo design tool. The colors are chosen from the color palette for the website.
