### **Strategy**

This project is to design and create a user-friendly and interactive website that is done mainly through HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The main goal of the website is to allow users to test their knowledge, learn new facts, and have fun with trivia questions. The quiz game help with concentration, identify gaps in knowledge, build confidence and help children retain information in a fun way. Our quiz game prevent the mind from wandering, ensuring information absorbation. It is also learning enjoyable. Incorrectly answered questions immediately highlight knowledge gaps.

By making the site fully responsive, the site aims to be easily accessible no matter which platform the user is viewing the site on.

### **Scope**

The main features that will be implemented into the website will be included on two separate pages. The design of the website should look fun, educational and interesting at the same time simple and eye-catching. In help to create this design will be carefully selected color palette and fonts.

The site will have challenging questions before the start of the quiz. This will help users think, that they are participating in an adventure quiz, so they can be motivated to answer the questions correctly to prove themselves that they are worthy of the challenge. The website will have how to play section, which will include the rules of the quiz. It will have also contact details and social media links, making it easy for users to get in touch.

### **Structure**

The structure of the website is to have two separate pages - game page and contact page. It is designed to be mobile-first design. Every page will have a header,logo and footer. There will be an additional 404.html page.

### **Skeleton**

To create the wireframes, the design tool Figma is used. There were fifteen frames created- for the main function on the two pages and for three devices- desktop, tablet, and mobile. They were created to help establish a clear and organized structure for the website. They provide an outline of the layout how elements will be arranged on the screen, and how the interface will adopt the different screen sizes and devices, laying the foundation for responsive design.

### **Surface**

**Colour**

The color palette is selected based on the unique meaning of each colors and their combination together. Purple and violet colors promote harmony of the mind and the emotions, contributing to mental balance and stability, peace of mind, a link between the spiritual and the physical worlds, between thought and ativity.The color orange radiates warmth and happiness, combining the physical energy and stimulation of red with the cheerfulness of yellow. The color psychology of orange is optimistic and uplifting, rejuvenating our spirit. Peach encourages great communication and conversation. It inspires good manners and puts people at ease. It has all the attributes of orange but in a much softer, gentler and more cautious form. This version of orange encourages vitality and self-control. Using apricot can evoke feelings of warmth and friendliness. This color communicates a sense of comfort and approachability, making it ideal for creating inviting and cheerful spaces.
The choice of colours will align with the colours of the images, used in the project. The palette were created using the site [Color-hex.com](https://www.color-hex.com/). Tints and Shades of these colours will be used also and are created using the site [Maketintsandshade.com](https://maketintsandshades.com/).

**Typography**

The fonts that will be used in the website will be imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and will be used [Engagement](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Engagement) and [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora). Semi-formal with a steady hand and soft contours, Engagement is a brush script that dances a line between vintage and modern flair. This classic calligraphic script font is perfect for amazing postcard designs, wedding invitation designs, image headings, and titling purposes. Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs.

**Logo**

The logo is created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGVX0sxbDk/QxmT7W9rV6dBT0eca0dxVw/edit) logo design tool. The colors are chosen from the color palette for the website. This will help users connect the logo with the colors of the company and website. Th symbol is related to the purpose of the website.

**Images**

The images on the pages were chosen to be relevant to the content of the page. The video has been selected to be educational to keep users more interested about our solar system and It is meant to be a prize at the end of the quiz.

**Icons**

The icons that will be used are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. Having icons as the social media links immediately allows the user to easily identify which social media platform is which. Icons for the website are carefully chosen to be semantic relevance to represent concepts. They help users quickly understand and navigate throughout the website. The icons on the footer are all easily appealing on the eye for the user.

**Sound**

The sounds in the quiz are from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/) website. They are used to enhance engagement and interactivity. Sound effects provide immediate feedback for correct and incorrect answers, making the experience more dynamic and enjoyable. Additionally, audio helps to guide users through the quiz and improve memory by reinforcing actions with auditory feedback. To ensure accessibility and user comfort, there is an options to mute or not the sound, ensuring the quiz is inclusive and customizable for everyone. A 15-second timer sound is included to add a sense of urgency and challenge to the quiz. It encourages quick thinking and decision-making, which makes the experience more engaging and dynamic. The timer also helps prevent overthinking or relying on external resources, ensuring that the answers are based on the participant's immediate knowledge.

## Credits

### Content

* The questions in this quiz were sourced from [Google](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=bg&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGxO_6_vCKAxXkVkEAHXwEOBsQPAgI), ensuring that they are accurate and relevant.

### Images and Sounds

All images have been downloaded from: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/). The sounds have been downloaded from [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/).

### Code

Code from EmailJS is used to create an API for sending emails directly from the quiz application without needing a dedicated server or backend. EmailJS allows integration with client-side code, enabling me to send email notifications, using their prebuilt code and templates. I implemented the provided code snippets and customized them to meet the specific requirements of the application, ensuring a seamless and efficient email-sending process.

Information on how to use the [JavaScript Fetch API](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data) to get data helped to understand how to retrieve data asynchronously from a server. It explains how to make HTTP requests, handle responses (e.g., JSON), and manage errors using Promises. This method allows you to easily interact with APIs, improving performance and simplifying the code compared to older methods like XMLHttpRequest.
